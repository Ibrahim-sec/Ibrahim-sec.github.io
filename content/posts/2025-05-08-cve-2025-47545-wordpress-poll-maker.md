I'm pleased to share details about **CVE-2025-47545**, a race condition vulnerability I discovered in the WordPress plugin "Poll Maker" that allowed users to bypass voting limitations and perform multiple unauthorized votes.

## Vulnerability Overview

**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-47545  
**Type**: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (Race Condition)  
**Affected Plugin**: Poll Maker by Ays Pro  
**Affected Versions**: n/a through 5.7.7  
**Fixed Version**: 5.7.8  
**Severity**: Medium

## Technical Details

The vulnerability existed in the voting mechanism of the Poll Maker plugin. Due to improper synchronization when handling concurrent requests, an attacker could exploit a race condition to submit multiple votes, effectively bypassing the plugin's voting limitation controls.

### The Race Condition

A race condition occurs when the behavior of software depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events. In this case:

1. The plugin checked if a user had already voted
2. If not, it recorded the vote
3. However, if multiple requests were sent simultaneously, the check could pass for multiple requests before any vote was recorded
4. This allowed the same user to vote multiple times

## Discovery Process

As part of my security research on WordPress plugins, I analyze common vulnerability patterns including:

- Input validation issues
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Race conditions in concurrent operations
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

During my analysis of the Poll Maker plugin, I identified that the voting mechanism lacked proper synchronization controls, making it vulnerable to race condition attacks.

## Responsible Disclosure Timeline

- **Discovery**: Identified the vulnerability during security research
- **Initial Report**: Reported to Patchstack for coordination
- **Vendor Notification**: Patchstack coordinated with the plugin developer
- **Patch Development**: Developer created fix for version 5.7.8
- **Public Disclosure**: CVE assigned and vulnerability details published

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow malicious users to:

- Manipulate poll results by submitting multiple votes
- Undermine the integrity of polling data
- Affect decision-making based on poll results

## Remediation

If you're using the Poll Maker plugin, ensure you're running **version 5.7.8 or later**. The patch includes proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race condition exploitation.

## Key Takeaways

This discovery highlights several important security principles:

1. **Concurrency is complex**: Race conditions can be subtle and difficult to detect
2. **Testing matters**: Security testing should include concurrent request scenarios
3. **Proper synchronization is critical**: Shared resources must be protected with appropriate locking mechanisms
4. **Responsible disclosure works**: Coordinated disclosure ensures users are protected before details are public

## For Plugin Developers

When developing WordPress plugins (or any web application), consider:

- Implementing proper locking mechanisms for shared resources
- Testing with concurrent requests
- Using database transactions where appropriate
- Validating state at every critical operation
- Following secure coding guidelines

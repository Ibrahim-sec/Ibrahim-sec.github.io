On November 1st, 2025, we successfully hosted **System Override CTF 2025** at Asia Pacific University (APU), bringing together over 300 participants from 10+ universities across Malaysia. As one of the lead organizers and CTO of BarqSec, this event represents months of planning, coordination, and teamwork.

## The Vision

When we started planning System Override CTF, our goal was simple: create a world-class cybersecurity competition that would challenge students and foster a community of security enthusiasts in Malaysia. We wanted to provide a platform where students could test their skills, learn from each other, and connect with the broader cybersecurity community.

## The Team

This event wouldn't have been possible without the incredible team at BarqSec:

- **Ibrahim M. Gholamy** (myself) - CTO
- **Gumana Abdullah Alshami**
- **OMAR AMOUDI**
- **Abduljalil Alanesi**

Together, we coordinated every aspect of the competition, from challenge creation to logistics and sponsorship.

## The Sponsor: Exploit3rs

We were incredibly fortunate to secure **Exploit3rs** from Dubai, UAE as our sponsor. They not only provided the CTF challenges but also contributed exciting prizes to support Malaysian students. This partnership brought international expertise to our local competition.

## The Competition

The event attracted participants from prestigious universities including:

- Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS
- Universiti Tenaga Nasional

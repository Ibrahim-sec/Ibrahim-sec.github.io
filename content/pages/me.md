## Hello! I'm Ibrahim M. Gholamy

I'm a cybersecurity student at Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation (APU) with a passion for finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities. Over the years, I have discovered **over 400+ vulnerabilities** in major companies including Google, Amazon, TikTok, and many others.

## What I Do

My expertise lies in **web application security**, **penetration testing**, and **malware analysis**. I actively participate in bug bounty programs on platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd, where I help organizations identify and fix security issues before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

### Key Areas of Focus

- **Bug Hunting & Web Security**: Identifying vulnerabilities in web applications through platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne
- **CTF Challenges**: Competing in Capture The Flag competitions, specializing in Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, and Forensics
- **SOC & Threat Analysis**: Working with SIEM tools and performing incident response

## Professional Experience

Currently, I serve as an **IT & Cybersecurity Intern** at Primary Guard, a Forest Interactive subsidiary, where I apply my security knowledge in a professional environment. I also hold the position of **Chief Technology Officer** at BarqSec, a cybersecurity startup, where I lead technical operations and guide the team in secure development practices.

Previously, I worked with the APU FSeC team, conducting penetration testing and identifying vulnerabilities in university systems.

## Notable Achievements

### CVE-2025-47545
I discovered and responsibly disclosed a race condition vulnerability in the WordPress plugin "Poll Maker," which allowed users to bypass voting limitations. The issue was patched in version 5.7.8 after coordination with Patchstack.

### NASA Security Report
I received an official acknowledgment letter from NASA for reporting a security vulnerability on their platform, contributing to the security of one of the world's most prestigious organizations.

### System Override CTF 2025
As one of the lead organizers, I helped coordinate System Override CTF 2025 at APU, which attracted over 300 participants from 10+ universities across Malaysia. The event was sponsored by Exploit3rs from Dubai, UAE.

### HackerOne Ambassador World Cup
I represented Saudi Arabia in the HackerOne Ambassador World Cup in both 2023 and 2024, collaborating with international teams to identify vulnerabilities and make the internet safer.

## Certifications

- **eLearnSecurity Web application Penetration Tester eXtreme (eWPTX)** - INE Security (May 2022)
- **AD-RTS** - CyberWarFare Labs (November 2025)

## Education

I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Science** at Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation (APU / APIIT) and De Montfort University.
